# my-utils

Small library of utilities I often use in JS/TS projects. Mostly consists
of porting the awesome Rust iterators to JS. Also, a sandbox for learning
test driven development, various testing strategies and publishing
to NPM registry.

## Features

- Fully type checked with Typescript
- Ported most of the Rust iterators
- Test driven development - 100% Jest coverage
- Mutation testing using Stryker.js
- Published to NPM under @maneren/utils
